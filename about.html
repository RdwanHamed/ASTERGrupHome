                    <h2>Our Story</h2>
                    <p>Aster Group Home was founded on a simple yet profound belief: every senior deserves to age with dignity, joy, and purpose. We recognized that many families struggle to find care solutions that honor their loved ones' independence while providing the support they need. That's why we created a unique model of house-call assisted living that brings professional, compassionate care directly to seniors' homes.</p>
                    <p>Our name, "Aster," represents the star-like flower that blooms beautifully in autumn—a symbol of wisdom, patience, and the beauty that comes with age. Just as the aster brings color and life to gardens, we bring warmth, care, and vitality to the lives of seniors and their families.</p>

                    <p>We believe that aging is not a decline but a continuation of life's journey. Every senior has a lifetime of experiences, wisdom, and contributions that deserve respect and honor. Our care approach ensures that your loved one's dignity is preserved in every interaction, decision, and moment.</p>
